# libtray

Nim wrapper for [tray](https://github.com/dmikushin/tray/tree/master).

Examples are available at [`examples/`](examples/).

## Compilation

This library supports similar define flags to uing (see [Static vs. dynamic linking](https://github.com/neroist/uing?tab=readme-ov-file#static-vs-dynamic-linking), just replace "libui" with "tray"). 

The dynlib and static lib paths may be configured with the `trayLib` define option.
